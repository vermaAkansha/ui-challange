UI code challenge.

## The task
The challenge is to achieve a responsive design as per the screens present in the assets directory. The screens are provided for 3 different resolutions. There is no need for implementing the undelying functionality.

This is a helper repo to get you started with.

- You are free to use any framework/pre-processor.
- Use icons/assets wherever required.

Akansha Verma: 
To solve the Challenge, I have used <picture> tag from html 5 which can ease the responsiveness of images as it accepts media query as well. The changed file is index.html.
